## Multigrid Methods

### Synopsis

**Multigrid Methods: Axiomatic Convergence Theory for Linear and Weakly Nonlinear Problems** is our book on multigrid theory and implementation for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, published by De Gruyter.

The book was written by [Steven M. Wise](https://github.com/stevenmwise), [Abner Salgado](https://sites.google.com/utk.edu/abnersg/), and me. It introduces both foundational and advanced aspects of multigrid methods, from linear elliptic model problems to weakly nonlinear settings.

We use an axiomatic and mostly matrix-based framework to make the theory clean and implementation-focused. The nonlinear material also connects to active research topics, including subspace-decomposition ideas.
