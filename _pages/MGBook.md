### Synopsis

**Multigrid Methods: Axiomatic Convergence Theory for Linear and Weakly Nonlinear Problems** is our book on multigrid theory and implementation for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, published by De Gruyter.

The book was written by <a href="https://github.com/stevenmwise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven M. Wise</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/utk.edu/abnersg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abner Salgado</a>, and me. It introduces both foundational and advanced aspects of multigrid methods, from linear elliptic model problems to weakly nonlinear settings.

We use an axiomatic and mostly matrix-based framework to make the theory clean and implementation-focused. The nonlinear material also connects to active research topics, including subspace-decomposition ideas.

### Availability

The electronic version is available on De Gruyter's [website](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783111354880). Physical copies can be purchased from major booksellers.
