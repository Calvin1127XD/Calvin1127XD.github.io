## About

I am **Calvin Wong**, a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (expected graduation: 2027). My work sits at the intersection of numerical analysis, PDE, scientific computing, and mathematical modeling.

I am a co-author (with Steven M. Wise and Abner J. Salgado) of the De Gruyter textbook **Multigrid Methods: Axiomatic Convergence Theory for Linear and Weakly Nonlinear Problems**. I also co-authored two recent papers on diffuse domain approximations with transmission-type boundary conditions, with a focus on asymptotics, numerics, and Gamma-convergence.

I have served as a Summer Internship Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (2024 and 2025), where I worked on computational optimization and machine-learning-driven workflows for scientific applications.

### Research Interests

- Numerical PDE and modeling
- Diffuse domain and multigrid methods
- Finite difference and finite element analysis
- Graph neural networks and reinforcement learning for scientific computing
- Mathematical imaging, differential geometry, and quasiconformal methods

### Current Focus

I am currently working on:

1. Diffuse domain methods for Poisson problems with transmission-type boundary conditions
2. Combinatorial optimization with graph convolutional networks and deep reinforcement learning
3. Numerical and theoretical foundations for efficient multigrid solvers
